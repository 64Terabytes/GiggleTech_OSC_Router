Step 2: Giggletech Software Setup
---------------------------------
Software Package Includes:
1. Giggletech_server_x.x.exe: Communicates with VRChat to send headpats to your Giggletech device.
2. Giggletech_VRC_Simulator.exe: Tests system configuration by emulating VRChat.
3. Giggletech_OSCQuery_Installer.exe: Ensures compatibility with other OSC-based programs.

Install the Software:
1. Download the latest version from the Giggletech GitHub.
2. Run the Giggletech_OSCQuery_Installer.exe to install the OSCQuery Helper.

Step 3: Configure the YML File
------------------------------
1. Find Your Device's IP:
   Visit http://giggletech.local. If it doesnâ€™t load, ensure the Bonjour Service is installed from https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/.

2. Edit the YML File:
   Open "config.yml" using Notepad. Replace the default IP (192.168.1.69) with the one obtained from giggletech.local or your static IP setup.

3. Multiple Devices:
   Add multiple devices to the YML by copying the format and assigning unique IPs. Power up each device separately.

4. Save Your Changes:
   After updating, save the file and close the editor.

Step 4: Test Your System
------------------------
Before entering VRChat:
1. Open the Giggletech Server software.
2. Run gigglepuck_vrc_simulator.exe to emulate a VRChat environment.
3. Follow the simulator prompts to confirm your hardware setup.
