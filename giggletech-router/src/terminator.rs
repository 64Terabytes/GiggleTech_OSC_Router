/*
    terminator.rs - Control Start/Stop Worker for Device Shutdown

    This module is responsible for managing a worker that sends stop signals (`0`) to devices in regular intervals 
    when certain conditions are met (such as proximity signals stopping). It can start or stop the worker as needed.

    **Key Features:**

    1. **Start Worker (`start`)**:
       - Spawns a worker task that continuously sends a stop signal (`0`) to a device every second.
       - Ensures the worker is not started if itâ€™s already running by checking the `AtomicBool`.

    2. **Stop Worker (`stop`)**:
       - Stops the worker by setting the `AtomicBool` to `false`, halting the periodic stop signal transmission.

    3. **Worker Task**:
       - The worker function runs in a loop, sending stop signals to the device while the worker is active.
       - It sleeps for 1 second between each stop signal, ensuring the device continues to receive stop commands 
         until the worker is stopped.

    **Usage**:
    - This module is used to continuously send stop signals to devices when needed, for instance, when a device 
      should halt due to inactivity or the end of a proximity event.
    - The worker can be started or stopped based on the system state, using the `start` and `stop` functions.
